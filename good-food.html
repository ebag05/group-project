        <p>Harlem is known internationally as the Black Mecca of the world, but Harlem has been home to many races and ethnic groups including the Dutch, Irish, German, Italian, and Jewish. Harlem was originally settled by the Dutch in 1658, but was largely farmland and undeveloped territory for approximately 200 years. As New York’s population grew, residential and commercial expansion moved northward, and development of the Harlem territory was evitable.</p>

        <h1>What is Soul Food?</h1>
        
        <p>What is soul food, anyway? A leftover from the 60s, "soul food" is still a perfectly good term. It was inspired by soul music, an expression first used by jazz musicians in the 1950s to acknowledge their inspiration in blues and gospel, and later deployed to describe a style of African-American pop that's still considered a golden age of American music. Soul food designates cooking that originated over centuries in the kitchens of African-American cooks in the South, but also included white, Native American, and Latin contributions.</p>
      
        <p>Though African-Americans were prominent figures even during colonial times, soul food was more recently brought to New York City during what has come to be known as the Great Migration — a period that began a century ago in response to lynching and other forms of racial terrorism that drove vast numbers of African-Americans to resettle in the North. (Other reasons included the comparative superiority of economic opportunities here.) Neighborhoods like Harlem and Bed-Stuy, along with Ft. Greene, Greenwich Village, and Jamaica, Queens, became hotbeds of soul food.</p>
      
        <p>Mainly pig and chicken based, and including elements carried to the South from Africa centuries earlier, the menu at these places included such standards as fried chicken, smothered pork chops, hot sage sausage, grits and eggs, collard greens (quintessentially African), mac and cheese (a Brit contribution), slab bacon, stewed okra with tomatoes, rice and black-eyed peas (aka hoppin’ John), cornbread, shrimp and grits, meatloaf (from the Germans), tamales (a Latin contribution), succotash (thank you, Native Americans), and fried whiting sandwiches.</p>
        
        <p>This menu was often served in small cafes run by women. Sadly, few of these old places — many founded in the 60s and even earlier — still exist. But new places in the old style have risen to take their place. Here is a collection of 10 old-fashioned cafes worth visiting for the excellence of their fare, and the rich tradition of African-American hospitality that makes the soul food taste even better.</p>
