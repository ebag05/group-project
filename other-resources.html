        <p>Harlem is known internationally as the Black Mecca of the world, but Harlem has been home to many races and ethnic groups including the Dutch, Irish, German, Italian, and Jewish. Harlem was originally settled by the Dutch in 1658, but was largely farmland and undeveloped territory for approximately 200 years. As New Yorkâ€™s population grew, residential and commercial expansion moved northward, and development of the Harlem territory was evitable.</p>

        <p>For those interested in its history, Harlem might be explored by inspecting its religious edifices (like the Abyssinian Baptist Church), elegant row houses that rival the brownstones of Brooklyn Heights and attractive parks (landmarks like Hamilton Grange and the Mount Morris Fire Watchtower can be found in St. Nicholas and Marcus Garvey Parks, respectively; note that the Fire Watchtower in Marcus Garvey Park is currently being restored). But there's much to admire about Harlem's present, too. The neighborhood has seen an influx of new shops, music halls and restaurants, including the acclaimed Red Rooster Harlem, from celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson, and The Cecil, Esquire magazine's 2014 pick for best new restaurant in America. The links below will help guide you along Harlem's past and future.</p>
