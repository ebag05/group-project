        <p>Harlem is known internationally as the Black Mecca of the world, but Harlem has been home to many races and ethnic groups including the Dutch, Irish, German, Italian, and Jewish. Harlem was originally settled by the Dutch in 1658, but was largely farmland and undeveloped territory for approximately 200 years. As New Yorkâ€™s population grew, residential and commercial expansion moved northward, and development of the Harlem territory was evitable.</p>

        <h1>Past and Present </h1>
        <p>While Harlem's past is full of historical moments, it's present is vastly changing. Each decade since the 1920s has looked and felt different, but it always feels like home. As new businesses open and some old businesses close, people leave and new people enter the haven of Harlem nothing can take away the spirit left behind. This will remind you of what has left and show you what is being created. </p>
